I was 15 when I decided to pursue a career in management/economics due to my addiction for strategy video games. 

I graduated in economics and during my 4 years of experience in the field I realized that what I enjoyed the most about the job 
was preparing excel files and not so much the financial analyses.

While I was producing a project to increase the efficiency of management control of real estate funds I had my first contact with programming. 
I was offered a VBA course to implement more efficiency in this project and fell in love instantly. 

Despite thereabout 10 years of dedication to economics it was an easy choice to let go of my old career and pursue something that fully makes me happy - coding.
